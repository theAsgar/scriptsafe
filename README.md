# ScriptSafe
A Chrome extension with over 107,000 users that brings some of NoScript's functionality to Chrome while emphasizing simplicity and intuitiveness (no affiliation to NoScript).

Note: due to the nature of this extension, this will break most sites! It is designed to learn over time with sites that you allow.

* block unwanted cookies
* "intuitive" icon that changes based on whether or not a page is whitelisted/blacklisted/bypassed
